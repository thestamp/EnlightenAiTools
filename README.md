Welcome to Enlighten AI Tools, an open-source project dedicated to enhancing the way we study and interact with educational content. 

The goal of this project is to provide a safe and innovative tool using AI (ChatGPT) that generates random questions from texts, guides learners to delve deeper into subjects, and tracks areas for improvement.

To try it out, go here: [Enlighten AI Tools](https://enlightenaitools.com/)

   - Progress tracking to identify areas for improvement (WIP).

2. **Faculty "Admin" App:** 
   - Textbook content management and editing.
   - Tailored educational material provisioning.
   - Student progress monitoring (WIP).
